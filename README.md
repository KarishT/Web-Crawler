# Web-Crawler
Web Crawler parses through a webpage and extracts the information we need. Eg. all the links on a web page, images etc.
Created using BeautifulSoup.
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after Tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. It is available for Python 2.6+ and Python 3.
